    <h1>Responsive Typography</h1>

    <p>
      This heading and paragraph text will change size based on your screen
      width. The typography automatically adapts to provide the best reading
      experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

    <p>
      Try resizing your browser window to see the text scale between different
      breakpoints. The font sizes follow a responsive scale that ensures
      readability across all screen sizes.
