  <h1>My Personal Introduction</h1>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hey, I’m <strong>Amber</strong>, 28 years old from Rehovot. I studied Computer Science and Neuroscience at Bar-Ilan University.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love learning new things and taking on challenges. When I’m not working, I enjoy simple moments like reading or going for a walk.

  <h2>My Interests</h2>
  <p>
    I love traveling, dancing, and diving.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides that, I’m really passionate about web development and building apps that people find useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m always curious - whether it’s about a new coding language or discovering a cool place to hike.

  <p>
    Right now, my main goal is to grow as a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> and create projects that actually make a difference.
  </p>

    Outside of work, I want to keep pushing myself to learn more and enjoy the journey.
